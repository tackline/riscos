QuickCaret...

Written by Richard Millican, Febrary 1993

A tiny program hacked-up in minutes - literally.
Do whatever you like with it, if you improve it,
let me know...
        
Ever found it annoying to have to keep clicking
windows to get the caret ? Well, load this little
program and the caret will move from window
to window automatically when you move the pointer.

There are a few problems with editors and
positioning, but you can still click to the required
position if needs be.

To quit from it you'll need to use the task manager,
no snazzy front ends here :-)

Hope someone finds it useful, if you're using a
task window based language that needs text importing
all the time then it's a must !

Version 1.01
        

Changes:

        o Rewritten in assembler.
        o Now loads as a Module.
        o Sleeps for 10cs between polls.
        o QuitQCaret Obey file to kill the module (quitting from the
                task manager still works, of course).

Problems:

        o DBox's may not know where to put caret or get confuzzed by
                the caret's position.
        o Some apps interpret gain and loss of caret specially
                (e.g. Mads Meisner-Jensen's Hextris).
        o Some apps do not pass on hot keys (e.g. the DDE FrontEnd).
