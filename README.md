My old RISC OS software. Written in ARM PROG26 mode.

Found off of the internet, though I may have a copy on an old hard drive. It will have been archived with *SparkFS*, and I don't know how to extract that the days.

**DragWindow** an assembly language module that allows moving, resizing and scrolling (X, Y or XY) windows by clicking anywhere in the window instead of a specific part of the frame. I do miss this, although two-finger scroll/scroll wheels half. Like a much better version of the earlier memory-hog *MoveWindow* (which also uses a whole one of your 128 pages). I think this should be the updated version with command line switches instead of the 1K version, but I may be wrong.

**QuickCaret** is my assembly language module conversion of *Reuben Thomas's* BASIC program. Again, nobody wants to lose 32K - that's as much memory as an unexpanded Acorn Electron.
